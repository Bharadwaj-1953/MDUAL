# Multiple Dynamic Outlier-Detection from a Data Stream by Exploiting Duality of Data and Queries

## Abstract
Real-time outlier detection from a data stream has become increasingly important in the current hyperconnected world.  
This project focuses on an important yet often unaddressed challenge in continuous outlier detection: the multiplicity and dynamicity of queries.  
This challenge arises because outliers evolve over time, but most state-of-the-art algorithms cannot handle multiple dynamic queries effectively â€” they process a fixed set of queries separately for each data point.

**MDUAL** is a novel algorithm based on a new idea called **duality-based unified processing**.  
By exploiting the **duality of data and queries**, MDUAL groups similar data points and similar queries together, allowing efficient and incremental processing.

Two main techniques embody the idea:
- **Data-Query Grouping**
- **Prioritized Group Processing**

Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that MDUAL achieves **216x to 221x faster execution** while consuming **11x to 13x less memory** compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, thus effectively addressing the multiplicityâ€“dynamicity challenge in streaming environments.
